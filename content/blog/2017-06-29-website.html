<h2>Goodbye GitHub Pages, I hope you’re not too upset!</h2>
<p>After finding myself increasingly frustrated with GitHub Pages inability to cooperate with my website engine of choice, Hugo, I’ve decided to make a move. Here are the reasons why:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Having all of my project pages being subpages of my personal page felt weird.</p></li>
<li><p>Dealing with git subtrees, merge conflicts on the master branch, and having to do all kinds of work-arounds to get Hugo to play nice with GitHub Pages was driving me crazy.</p></li>
<li><p>I found a much easier way!</p></li>
</ol>

<div id="hello-netlify" class="section level2">
<h2>Hello Netlify!</h2>
<p>I’ve moved to Netlify. It’s amazing, almost too easy. There <em>must</em> be a catch; nothing in life is ever <em>this</em> easy…</p>
<p>The new workflow to get the website set up is pretty basic: simply make a GitHub repository containing your website, tell Netlify what the repository is called and push. Bam! Your website is now ready!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some more explicit details, here they are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Start a new github repository for your website and call it anything you like. By that I mean that it doesn’t have to be <code>username.github.io</code>. I called mine <code>personal-webpage</code>. So creative, I know.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> to design your page with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. There are lots of cool <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a> available. Choose a good one.</p></li>
<li><p>Push your website, content and all, to your new repo.</p></li>
<li><p>Head on over to <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">netlify</a>, create and account/log in and hit “New site from Git”.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Step 1: Set the Continuous Deployment Git provider to GitHub (or whichever provider you use).</p></li>
<li><p>Step 2: Choose the repository containing your website.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 3: Set the Build command to hugo_0.19 (or whichever version you want), and the Publish directory to “public” (this is the folder in which Hugo by default puts the actual webpage files when it’s built).</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Hit “Deploy site”.</p></li>
<li><p>If you like you can choose to “Change site name”.</p></li>
<li><p>Your site can now be found at <code>sitename.netlify.com</code>!</p></li>
<li><p>Everytime you push new content to the GitHub repo, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your site. You can just sit back and relax :).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s probably a good idea to buy a domain name from somewhere like Google Domains for like $10/year and point that domain name towards your netlify site, but otherwise you’re good to go!</p>
