<p>Many years ago I taught a stats class for which one of the topics was hypothesis testing. Many of the students had a hard time remembering what situation each test was designed for, so I made a flowchart to help piece together the wild world of hypothesis tests.</p>
<p>While the flowchart isn’t pretty (if I made it today, it would be much more attractive), I feel like it might be useful for others, so here it is:</p>

<p>(if you all like it - I’ll make a pretty version!)</p>
