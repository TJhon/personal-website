<p>Web stuff</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Website</strong>: I wrote my website using <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> and host it using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>. I have previously used both Jekyll and Hugo hosted on github pages, but overall find the blogdown + netlify combination to be much more straightforward. I wrote a <a href="http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-06-29-website/">blog post</a> on how I made my website a while ago.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web development</strong>: I’ve been making my way through Joel Ross and Mike Freeman’s course book on <a href="https://info343.github.io/">Client-Side Web Development</a> to learn the absolute basics of web development (namely html, css, and javascript). It’s super easy to read and filled with examples.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>D3.js</strong>: By far the best resource I’ve found by far for learning D3 is Scott Murray’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491921285/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Interactive Data Visualization for the Web: An Introduction to Designing with D3</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Stats stuff</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Causal Inference</strong>: When I started learning about causal inference, I found most of the papers totally unintelligible. The best resource I found for learning the basics of causal inference was Imbens and Rubin’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Causal-Inference-Statistics-Biomedical-Sciences/dp/0521885884">Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction</a>, which was surprisingly accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visualization stuff</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Colours</strong>: My favourite way to choose colors for a plot is a website called <a href="https://coolors.co/" class="uri">https://coolors.co/</a>, which randomly generates appealing color palettes for you to choose from. Just hit the space bar to generate a new palette!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data viz best practices</strong>: I absolutely loved Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119002257/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals</a>. I totally bought it on a whim a couple of years ago, and surprisingly learnt a huge amount. This book made me a lot more thoughtful about the visualizations that I produce.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>R stuff</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tidyverse</strong>: The resource that I usually point people towards for learning the tidyverse is Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham’s <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R packages</strong>: When I made my first R package, Hadley Wickham’s <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">book on R packages</a> was indispensable!</p></li>
</ul>
