Hi there! I'm Rebecca Barter. I'm so glad you've made it to my page.

Originally from Australia, I moved to California in 2014 and am now towards the tail-end of my PhD in Statistics at UC Berkeley where I'm advised primarily by Prof Bin Yu. I have been fortunate to be a Data Science Fellow for the past few years at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)](https://bids.berkeley.edu). 

My research interests lie primarily in applications to medical domains (such as predicting surgical site infections using electronic medical records). My dual passions are explaining "seemingly complicated" concepts to others in plain English, and exploring and presenting the stories that underlie complex datasets.

I have dabbled in writing software as the author of the [superheat](https://github.com/rlbarter/superheat) R package for creating beautiful and customizable heatmaps in R.

Looking for useful data science resources? Check out my [useful resources](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/useful_resources/) page!

When I'm not doing R or stats stuff, I'm usually found climbing rocks somewhere, taking photos of beautiful places (check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rlbarter/)), or throwing wonky mugs and bowls at the pottery studio!
