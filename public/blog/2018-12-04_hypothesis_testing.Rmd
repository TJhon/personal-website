description: "A flowchart to decide what hypothesis test to use." 
---

Many years ago I taught a stats class for which one of the topics was hypothesis testing. Many of the students had a hard time remembering what situation each test was designed for, so I made a flowchart to help piece together the wild world of hypothesis tests.

While the flowchart isn't pretty (if I made it today, it would be much more attractive), I feel like it might be useful for others, so here it is:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("/img/hypothesis_testing/Hypothesis_testing_flow_mean.png")
```

(maybe if people like it - I'll make a pretty version!)
