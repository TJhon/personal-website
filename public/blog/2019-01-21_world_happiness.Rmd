Over the new year I decided to work on my D3.js skills (rather than do the actual work that I probably should've done) by submitting an entry to the [World Data Visualization competition](https://wdvp.worldgovernmentsummit.org/?mc_cid=94a374db6f&mc_eid=43391d3299). 

The interactive version of the fruits of my labour can be found by clicking [here](http://bl.ocks.org/rlbarter/raw/22670f3a7429316bd893078e57e23345/). Below is a static screenshot.

Essentially, the first screen shows each country's happiness score (and are colored accordingly using the [viridis]() color palette). When you hover over a bubble, it reveals which country each bubble belongs to. If you click on a variable name, the position of each bubble is jiggled to its new ranking according to the variable selected.

When I began to create this visualization, I had a picture in my head of a plot that a lot of Google searching lead me to realize was called a ["beeswarm plot"](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320), which is essentially a jittered one-dimensional scatterplot where the points are kind of "glued" together.

The main thing I struggled with when creating this visualization was realizing that *forces* in D3 are inherently different from *transitions* when I was implementing the buttons. But once I wrapped my head around these different types of "simulations", a lot of things magically started falling into place.

Most of all, I learnt a huge amount from the process and am really proud of my second-ever D3 project!
