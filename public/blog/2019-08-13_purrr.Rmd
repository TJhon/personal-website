Purrr is one of those packages that you keep hearing about, and you know you should probably learn it, but you just never seem to get around to it. 

At it's core, purrr is all about iteration. Purrr introduces map functions (the tidyverse's answer to base R's apply functions) as well as some new functions for manipulating lists. To get a quick snapshot of any tidyverse package, a nice place to go from here is the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/purrr.pdf). 

Another useful resource for learning about purrr is [Jenny Bryan's tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/). Jenny's tutorial is fantastic. This post is a lot shorter and will get you up and running with purrr very quickly.

While the workhorse of dplyr is the data frame, the workhorse of purrr is the list. If you aren't familiar with lists, hopefully this will help you understand what they are:

- A **vector** is a way of storing many individual elements (a single number or a single character or string) of the same type together in a single object,

- A **data frame** is a way of storing many vectors of the same length but possibly of different types together in a single object

- A **list** is a way of storing many objects of any type (e.g. data frames, plots, vectors) together in a single object

Here is an example of a list that has three elements: a single number, a vector and a data frame

```{r}
my_first_list <- list(my_number = 5,
                      my_vector = c("a", "b", "c"),
                      my_dataframe = data.frame(a = 1:3, b = c("q", "b", "z"), c = c("bananas", "are", "so very great")))
my_first_list
```

Note that a data frame is actually a special case of a list where each element of the list is a vector of the same length.


# Map functions: beyond apply 


A **map function** is one that applies the same action/function to every element of an object (e.g. each entry of a list or a vector, or each of the columns of a data frame). 

If you're familiar with the base R `apply()` functions, then it turns out that you are already familiar with map functions, even if you didn't know it!


The `apply()` functions are set of super useful base-R functions for iteratively performing an action across entries of a vector or list without having to write a for-loop. The most common apply functions are 

`apply(matrix, margin, fun)` applies a function, `fun`, across each of the rows (if you set `margin = 1`) or each of the columns (if you set `margin = 2`) of a `matrix` (or array) and returns a vector.

`sapply(object, fun)` applies a function, `fun`, to each entry of an `object` (which could be a vector, a data frame or a list), and usually returns a vector, but sometimes it returns a matrix, and often it is difficult to guess what type of object it will return before you run your code.

`lapply(list, fun)` applies a function, `fun`, to each entry of a `list`, and returns a list. This one at least usually makes sense relative to the other apply functions.

While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the base R apply functions, the syntax is somewhat inconsistent across the different apply functions, and the expected type of the object they return is often ambiguous (at least it is for `sapply`...). Each of `purrr`'s map functions can be applied to vectors, lists and data frames. 
It is useful to remember that a data frame is a special type of a list where each columns of the data frame corresponds to an entry of the list. 

One of the primary features of `purrr`'s map functions is that you need to specify the form of your output as a function suffix separated by an underscore. The first element is always the data object over which you want to iterate, and the second argument is always the function that you want to iteratively apply. For example:

- `map(object, fun)` is the primary mapping function and returns a list

- `map_df(object, fun)` returns a data frame

- `map_dbl(object, fun)` returns a numeric (double) vector

- `map_chr(object, fun)` returns a character vector

- `map_lgl(object, fun)` returns a logical vector



The **input** to any `map` function is always either 

- a **vector** (of any type), in which case the iteration is done over the entries of the vector

- a **list**, in which case the iteration is performed over the elements of the list

- a **data frame**, in which case the iteration is performed over the columns of the data frame (which, since a data frame is a special kind of list, is technically the same as the previous point)

The **output** of each map function is specified by the term that follows the underscore in the function name. 


Consistent with the way of the tidyverse, the first argument of each mapping function is always the data object that you want to map over and the second argument is the function that you want to apply to each element of the data object. Since the first argument is always the data, this means that map functions play nicely with pipes (`%>%`). 

If you've never seen pipes before, they're really useful (originally from the `magrittr` package, but also ported with the `dplyr` package and thus with the `tidyverse`). Piping allows you to string together many functions by piping an object (which itself might be the output of a function) into the first argument of the next function. If you'd like to learn more about pipes, check out my [tidyverse blog posts](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/).


Throughout this post I will demonstrate each of purrr's functionalities using both a simple numeric example (to explain the concept) and the gapminder data (to show a more complex example).



## Simplest usage: repeated looping with map

Fundamentally, maps are for iteration. In the example below I will iterate through the vector `c(1, 4, 7)` by adding 10 to each entry. This action on a single number, which we will call `.x` (for reasons that will become clear later), can be written as a function

```{r}
addTen <- function(.x) {
  return(.x + 10)
}
```

To iterate this action over all entries of a vector, a list or columns of a data frame, and return the values as a list, we can use the `map()` function. If we are iterating over a vector, `map()` returns a list where

- the first element of the list is the result of applying the function to the first element of the `.x` input, 

- the second element of the list is the result of applying the function to the second element of the `.x` input,

- and so on

The following code chunks show that no matter if the input object is a vector, a list, or a data frame, `map()` always returns a list.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
map(.x = c(1, 4, 7), 
    .f = addTen)
```

```{r}
map(.x = list(1, 4, 7), 
    .f = addTen)
```

```{r}
map(.x = data.frame(1, 4, 7), 
    .f = addTen)
```

If we wanted to `map` to some other object type, we need to use a different function. For instance to map the input to a numeric (double) vector, you can use the `map_dbl()` ("map to a double") function.


```{r}
map_dbl(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)
```

To map to a character vector, you can use the `map_chr()` ("map to a character") function.

```{r}
map_chr(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)
```

Unsurprisingly, if you want to return a data frame, then you would use the `map_df()` function. However, you need to make sure that in each iteration you're returning a data frame which has consistent column names. `map_df` will automatically bind the rows of each iteration. 

For this example, we wand to return a data frame with the original number and the number plus ten.

```{r}
map_df(c(1, 4, 7), function(.x) {
  return(data.frame(old_number = .x, 
                    new_number = addTen(.x)))
})
```


Another function to be aware of is `modify()`, which is just like the map functions, but always returns an object the same type as the input object.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
modify(.x = c(1, 4, 7), 
    .f = addTen)
```

```{r}
modify(.x = list(1, 4, 7), 
    .f = addTen)
```

```{r}
modify(.x = data.frame(1, 4, 7), 
    .f = addTen)
```


Modify also has a pretty useful sibling, `modify_if()`, that only applies the function to elements that satisfy a specific criteria. For instance, the following example only modifies the third entry since it is greater than 5.

```{r}
modify_if(.x = list(1, 4, 7), 
          .p = function(x) x > 5,
          .f = addTen)
```

## The tilde-dot shorthand for functions


To make the code more concise you can use the tilde-dot shorthand for anonymous functions (the functions that you create as arguments of other functions).

The notation works by replacing

```{r eval = FALSE}
function(x) {
  x + 10
}
```

with 

```{r eval = FALSE}
~{.x + 10}
```

`~` indicates that you have started an anonymous function, and the argument of the anonymous function can be referred to using `.x` (or simply `.`). Unlike normal function arguments that can be anything that you like, the tilde-dot function argument is always `.x`.


Thus, instead of defining the `addTen()` function separately, we could use the tilde-dot shorthand

```{r}
map_dbl(c(1, 4, 7), ~{. + 10})
```

or 

```{r}
map_dbl(c(1, 4, 7), ~{.x + 10})
```

(i.e. you can use either `.` or `.x` as the argument).





## Applying map functions in a slightly more interesting context

Throughout this tutorial, we will use the gapminder dataset that can be loaded directly if you're connected to the internet. Each function will first be demonstrated using a simple numeric example, and then will be demonstrated using a more complex practical example based on the gapminder dataset.

My general workflow involves loading the original data and saving it as an object with a meaningful name and an `_orig` suffix. I then define a copy of the original dataset without the `_orig` suffix. Having an original copy of my data in my environment means that it is easy to check that my manipulations do what I expected. I will make direct data cleaning modifications to the `gapminder` data frame, but will never edit the `gapminder_orig` data frame. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# to download the data directly:
gapminder_orig <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
# define a copy of the original dataset that we will clean and play with 
gapminder <- gapminder_orig
```

The gapminder dataset has 1704 rows containing information on population, life expectancy and GDP per capita by year and country. 

A "tidy" data frame is one where every row is a single observational unit (in this case, indexed by country and year), and every column corresponds to a variable that is measured for each observational unit (in this case, for each country and year, a measurement is made for population, continent, life expectancy and GDP). If you'd like to learn more about "tidy data", I highly recommend reading [Hadley Wickham's tidy data article](vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). 

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```


An example of simple usage of the `map_` functions is to summarize each column. For instance, you can identify the type of each column by applying the `class()` function to each column. Since the output of the `class()` function is a character, we will use the `map_chr()` function:

```{r}
# apply the class() function to each column
gapminder %>% map_chr(~class(.x))
```

Note that when you're applying a named function, you can just provide the name of the function, without needing to put in any arguments.

```{r}
# apply the class() function to each column
gapminder %>% map_chr(class)
```

Similarly, if you wanted to identify the number of distinct values in each column, we could apply the `n_distinct()` function from the dplyr package to each column. Since the output of `n_distinct()` is a numeric (a double), we use the `map_dbl()` function so that the results of each iteration (the application of `n_distinct()` to each column) are concatenated into a numeric vector:

```{r}
# apply the n_distinct() function to each column
gapminder %>% map_dbl(n_distinct)
```

If you want to do something a little more complicated, such return a few different summaries of each column in a data frame, you can use `map_df()`. When things are getting a little bit more complicated, you typically need to use an anonymous function, which is a temporary function (that you define as the function argument to the map) that you want to apply to each column. 

The code below defines a lambda function that calculates the number of distinct entries and the type of the current column (which is defined arbitrarily as `x`), and then combines them into a two-column data frame. Once it has iterated through each of the columns, the map function combines the data frames row-wise into a single data frame.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>% map_df(~(data.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),
                                  class = class(.x))))
```

Note that we've lost the variable names! The variable names correspond to the names of the objects over which we are iterating (a column name is like the name of the list element), and these are not automatically included as a column in the output data frame. You can tell `map_df()` to include them using the `.id` argument of `map_df()`. This will automatically take the name of the element being iterated over and include it in the column corresponding to whatever we set `.id` to.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>% map_df(~(data.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),
                                  class = class(.x))),
                     .id = "variable")
```


If you're having trouble thinking through these map actions, I recommend that you first figure out what the code would be to do what you want for a single element, and then paste it into the `map_df()` function (a nice trick I saw Hadley Wickham used a few years ago when he presented on purrr at RLadies SF).

For instance, since the first element of the gapminder data frame is the first column, let's define `.x` in our environment to be this first column.

```{r}
.x <- gapminder %>% pluck(1)
.x
```


Then, we want to create a data frame for this column that tells us the number of distinct entries, and the class of the column. 

```{r}
data.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),
           class = class(.x))
```

Since this has done what we want for the first column, we can paste this code into the map function using the tilde-dot shorthand.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
gapminder %>% map_df(~(data.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),
                                  class = class(.x))),
                     .id = "variable")

```


`map_df()` is definitely one of the most powerful functions of `purrr` in my opinion, and is probably the one that I use most. 


## Maps with multiple input objects

After gaining a basic understanding of purrr's map functions, you can start to do some fancier stuff. For instance, what if you want to perform a map that iterates through two objects. For instance, let's use map functions to create a *list of plots* that compare life expectancy and GDP per capita for each continent/year combination.

The map function will be `map2()` (named because it iterated over *two* things), and has the form

```{r eval = FALSE}
map2(.x = object1, # the first object to iterate over
     .y = object2, # the second object to iterate over
     .f = plotFunction(.x, .y))
```

First, you meed to define a vector (or list) of continents and a paired vector (or list) of years that you want to iterate through. Note that 

- the first iteration will correspond to the first continent in the continent vector and the first year in the year vector,

- the second iteration will correspond to the second continent in the continent vector and the second year in the year vector.

This might seem obvious, but it is a natural instinct to assume that it will automatically perform the action on *all* combinations that can be made from the two vectors. For instance if you have a continent vector `c("Americas", "Asia")` and a year vector `c(1952, 2007)`, then you might assume that it will iterate over the Americas for 1952 and for 2007, and then Asia for 1952 and 2007. It won't though. The iteration will actually be first the Americas for 1952 only, and then Asia for 2007 only. 

First, let's get our vectors of continents and years, starting by obtaining all distinct combinations of continents and years that appear in the data.

```{r}
continent_year <- gapminder %>% distinct(continent, year)
continent_year
```

Then extracting the continent and year pairs as separate vectors

```{r}
# extract the continent and year pairs as separate vectors
continents <- continent_year %>% pull(continent) %>% as.character
years <- continent_year %>% pull(year)
```

Just like the anonymous argument in `map` is `.x`, in `map2` the two anonymous arguments are `.x` for the first object being iterated over, and `.y` for the second object being iterated over. 

So to figure out what the function inside `map2()` will look like, we will write the code for the first iteration (the first continent and the first year, which happen to be Asia in 1952). 

```{r}
# try to figure out the code for the first example
.x <- continents[1]
.y <- years[1]
# make a scatterplot of GDP vs life expectancy in all Asian countries for 1952
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == .x,
         year == .y) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  ggtitle(glue::glue(.x, " ", .y))
```

This seems to have worked. So we can copy-and-paste the code into the `map2` function

```{r}
plot_list <- map2(.x = continents, 
                  .y = years, 
                  .f = ~{
                    gapminder %>% 
                      filter(continent == .x,
                             year == .y) %>%
                      ggplot() +
                      geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
                      ggtitle(glue::glue(.x, " ", .y))
                  })
```

And we can look at a few of the entries of the list to see that they make sense

```{r}
plot_list[[1]]
plot_list[[22]]
```

`pmap()` allows you to iterate over an arbitrary number of objects.



## List columns and Nested data frames

Some crazy stuff starts happening when we learn that tibble columns can be lists (as opposed to vectors, which is what they usually are). This is where the difference between tibbles and data frames becomes real. 

For instance, a tibble can be "nested" where the tibble is essentially split into separate data frames based on a grouping variable, and these separate data frames are stored as entries of a list (that is then stored in the `data` column of the data frame).

Below I nest the gapminder data by continent.

```{r}
gapminder_nested <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  nest()
gapminder_nested
```

The first entry in the `data` column corresponds to the entire gapminder dataset for Asia.

```{r}
gapminder_nested$data[[1]]
```

Using dplyr functions, this can be written as 

```{r}
gapminder_nested %>% 
  # extract the first entry from the data column
  pluck(data, 1)
```

Whereas the 5th entry in the `data` column corresponds to the entire gapminder dataset for Oceania.

```{r}
gapminder_nested %>% pluck("data", 5)
```

You might be asking at this point *why* you would ever want to nest your data frame. It just doesn't seem like that useful a thing to do... until you realise that you now have the power to use dplyr manipulations on more complex objects that can be stored in a list. 

However, since actions such as `mutate()` are applied directly to the entire column (which is usually a vector, so is fine), we run into issues when we try to mutate a list. For instance, since columns are usually vectors, normal vectorized functions work just fine on them


```{r}
tibble(vec_col = 1:10) %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(vec_col))
```

but when the column is a list, vectorized functions don't know what to do with them, and we get an error that says `Error in sum(x) : invalid 'type' (list) of argument`

```{r}
list_col_tibble <- tibble(list_col = list(c(1, 5, 7), 5, c(10, 10, 11))) 
list_col_tibble
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
list_col_tibble %>% 
  mutate(sum = sum(list_col))
```

To apply mutate functions to a list-column, you need to wrap it in a map function.

```{r}
list_col_tibble %>%
  mutate(sum = map(list_col, sum))
```

Since `map()` returns a list itself, the output of the function we're applying to each list element `sum` is stored in its own list element. The `sum` column is thus itself a list

```{r}
list_col_tibble %>%
  mutate(sum = map(list_col, sum)) %>% 
  pull(sum)
```


What could we do if we wanted it to be a vector? We could use the `map_dbl()` function instead!

```{r}
list_col_tibble %>%
  mutate(sum = map_dbl(list_col, sum))
```

### Nesting the gapminder data

Let's return to the nested gapminder dataset. I want to calculate the average life expectancy within each continent and add it as a new column using `mutate()`. Based on the example above, can you explain why the following code doesn't work?

```{r}
gapminder_nested %>% 
  mutate(avg_lifeExp = mean(data$lifeExp))
```


This code is trying to extract the `lifeExp` entry from the *list* of data frames, rather from each individual data frame itself. To do this, we need to again use a map function.

Think of an individual data frame as `.x`. The following code defines `.x` to be the first entry of the `data` column (this is the data frame for Asia).

```{r}
# the first entry of the "data" column
.x <- gapminder_nested %>% pluck("data", 1)
.x
```

Then to calculate the average life expectancy for Asia, we would write 

```{r}
mean(.x$lifeExp)
```

So copy-pasting this into the `map_dbl()` function, we get what we wanted!

```{r}
gapminder_nested %>% 
  mutate(avg_lifeExp = map_dbl(data, ~{mean(.x$lifeExp)}))
```

I hear what you're saying... this is something that we could have done a lot more easily using standard dplyr commands. Well keep your pants on, because the next example will knock your socks off! (I recognize that that sentence made no sense, but I kind of like it, so it's staying).

We're about to fit a model separately for each continent, and evaluate it, all within a single tibble!

First, let's use what we've just learned to fit a linear model for each continent and store it as a list-column. If the data frame for a single continent is `.x`, then the model we want to fit is `lm(lifeExp ~ pop + gdpPercap + year, data = .x)` (check for yourself that this does what you expect). So we can copy-past this command into the `map()` function within the `mutate()`


```{r}
# fit a model separately for each continent
gapminder_nested <- gapminder_nested %>% 
  mutate(lm_obj = map(data, ~lm(lifeExp ~ pop + gdpPercap + year, data = .x)))
gapminder_nested
```

Where the first linear model (for Asia) is

```{r}
gapminder_nested %>% pluck("lm_obj", 1)
```


We can then predict the response for the training data stored in the `data` column. 

When things get a little more complicated I like to have more meaningful function arguments, so I'm going to use a full anonymous function rather than the tilde-dot shorthand. Now since we need to iterate over both the `data` column and the `lm_obj` column, we will use the `map2()` function to do our mutation.


```{r}
# fit a model separately for each continent
gapminder_nested <- gapminder_nested %>% 
  mutate(pred = map2(lm_obj, data, function(.lm, .data) predict(.lm, .data)))
gapminder_nested
```

And we can then calculate the correlation between the predicted response and the true response, this time using the `map2()_dbl` function since we want the output the be a vector rather than a list of single elements.

```{r}
# fit a model separately for each continent
gapminder_nested <- gapminder_nested %>% 
  mutate(cor = map2_dbl(pred, data, function(.pred, .data) cor(.pred, .data$lifeExp)))
gapminder_nested
```

Holy guacamole, that is so awesome!



## Advanced exercise

The goal of this exercise is to fit a separate linear model for each continent without splitting up the data. Using `group_by()`, `nest()` and several mutate statements including `broom::tidy()`, create the following data frame

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate(lm_obj = map(data, ~lm(lifeExp ~ pop + year + gdpPercap, data = .))) %>%
  mutate(lm_tidy = map(lm_obj, broom::tidy)) %>%
  transmute(continent, lm_tidy) %>%
  unnest()
```

If you want to stop here, you will already know more than most purrr users. The remainder of this blog post involves little-used features of purrr for manipulating lists.



# Additional purrr functionalities for lists


To demonstrate how to use purrr to manipulate lists, we will split the gapminder dataset into a list containing data frames (as opposed to a data frame containing a list-column). To make sure it's easy to follow, we will only keep 5 rows from each continent.

```{r}
gapminder_list <- gapminder %>% split(gapminder$continent) %>%
  map(~sample_n(., 5))
gapminder_list
```

## Keep/Discard: select_if for lists

`keep()` selects elements of a list that satisfy a given condition, much like `select_if()` selects columns of a data frame that satisfy a given condition.

The following code only keeps the gapminder continent data frames (the elements of the list) that have an average life expectancy of at least 70.


```{r}
gapminder_list %>%
  keep(~{mean(.x$lifeExp) > 70})
```

`discard()` does the opposite of `keep()`: it discards any elements that satisfy your logical condition.


## Reduce


`reduce()` is designed to combine (reduces) all of the elements of a list into a single object by iteratively applying a binary function (a function that takes two inputs). 

For instance, applying a reduce function to add up all of the elements of the vector `c(1, 2, 3)` is like doing `sum(sum(1, 2), 3)`: first it applies `sum` to `1` and `2`, then it applies `sum` again to the output of `sum(1, 2)` and `3`.

```{r}
reduce(c(1, 2, 3), sum)
```

`accumulate()` also returns the intermediate values. 

```{r}
accumulate(c(1, 2, 3), sum)
```

An example of when `reduce()` might come in handy is when you want to perform many `left_join()`s in a row, or to do repeated `rbinds()` (e.g. to bind the rows of the list back together into a single data frame)

```{r}
gapminder_list %>%
  reduce(rbind)

## Logical statements for list elements

Asking logical questions of a list can be done using `every()` and `some()`. For instance to ask whether *every* continent has average life expectancy greater than 70, you can use `every()`

```{r}
gapminder_list %>% every(~{mean(.x$life) > 70})
```

To ask whether *some* continents have average life expectancy greater than 70, you can use `some()`

```{r}
gapminder_list %>% some(~{mean(.x$life) > 70})
```

An equivalent of `%in%` for lists is `has_element()`.

```{r}
list(1, c(2, 5, 1), "a") %>% has_element("a")
```

Most of these functions also work on vectors.

Now go forth and purrr!
