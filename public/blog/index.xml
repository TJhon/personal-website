      <title>mutate_all(), select_if(), summarise_at()... what&#39;s the deal with scoped verbs?!</title>

      <description>A quick useful aside: Using shorthand for functions The _if() scoped variant: perform an operation on variables that satisfy a logical criteria select_if() rename_if() mutate_if() summarise_if()  The _at() scoped variant: perform an operation only on variables specified by name Select helpers rename_at() mutate_at() summarise_at()  The _all() scoped variant: perform an operation on all variables at once rename_all() mutate_all() summarise_all()  Conclusion   I often find myself wishing that I could apply the same mutate function to several columns in a data frame at once, such as convert all factors to characters, or do something to all columns that have missing values, or select all variables whose names end with _important.</description>

      <description>Over the new year I decided to work on my D3.js skills (rather than do the actual work that I probably should’ve done) by submitting an entry to the World Data Visualization competition.
The interactive version of the fruits of my labour can be found by clicking here. Below is a static screenshot.

Essentially, the first screen shows each country’s happiness score (and are colored accordingly using the viridis color palette).</description>

      <title>Which hypothesis test should I use? A flowchart</title>

      <description>Many years ago I taught a stats class for which one of the topics was hypothesis testing. Many of the students had a hard time remembering what situation each test was designed for, so I made a flowchart to help piece together the wild world of hypothesis tests.
While the flowchart isn’t pretty (if I made it today, it would be much more attractive), I feel like it might be useful for others, so here it is:</description>

      <description>While living in Seattle, I rode to and from Fremont every day on the Burke Gilman bike trail. Little did I know that everytime I went past NE 70th St, I (along with everyone else) was being recorded… It turns out that hourly data of traffic on the Burke Gilman trail is publicly available online. I decided to try out my D3 skills and make a cute little visualization of an average day in the life of the Burke Gilman trail.</description>

      <title>Getting fancy with ggplot2: code for alternatives to grouped bar charts</title>
      <link>/blog/2018-05-29_getting_fancy_ggplot2/</link>

      <description>Here I provide the code I used to create the figures from my previous post on alternatives to grouped bar charts. You are encouraged to play with them yourself!
The key to creating unique and creative visualizations using libraries such as ggplot (or even just straight SVG) is (1) to move away from thinking of data visualization only as the default plot types (bar plots, boxplots, scatterplots, etc), and (2) to realise that most visualizations are essentially lines and circles that you can arrange however you desire in space.</description>

      <description>At some point in your life you have probably found yourself standing face-to-face with a beast known as a grouped bar chart. Perhaps it was in a research paper where the authors were trying to compare the results of several models across different datasets, or it was in a talk given by a colleague who was trying to compare the popularity of different products among distinct groups of consumers.
The first time you encountered a grouped bar chart you might have thought “what a neat way to put so much information in a single plot!</description>

      <description>Suppose, as many do, that we want to estimate the effect of an action (or treatment) on an outcome. As an example, we might be interested in estimating the effect of receiving a drug vs not receiving a drug on the incidence of heart disease. In an ideal futuristic world, we would take each individual in our population and split them into two identical humans: one who receives the treatment and the other who doesn’t.</description>

      <description>Note: This tutorial was based on an older version of the abalone data that had a binary old varibale rather than a numeric age variable. It has been modified lightly so that it uses a manual old variable (is the abalone older than 10 or not) and ignores the numeric age variable.
Materials prepared by Rebecca Barter. Package developed by Max Kuhn.

      <title>A Basic Data Science Workflow</title>

      <description>Developing a seamless, clean workflow for data analysis is harder than it sounds, especially because this is something that is almost never explicitly taught. Apparently we are all just supposed to “figure it out for ourselves”. For most of us, when we start our first few analysis projects, we basically have no idea how we are going to structure all of our files, or even what files we will need to make.</description>

      <title>The intuition behind inverse probability weighting in causal inference</title>
      <link>/blog/2017-07-05-ip-weighting/</link>

      <description>In my previous post, I introduced causal inference as a field interested in estimating the unobservable causal effects of a treatment: i.e. the difference between some measured outcome when the individual is assigned a treatment and the same outcome when the individual is not assigned the treatment.
If you’d like to quickly brush up on your causal inference, the fundamental issue associated with making causal inferences, and in particular, the troubles that arise in the presence of confounding, I suggest you read my previous post on this topic.</description>

      <description>Often in science we want to be able to quantify the effect of an action on some outcome. For example, perhaps we are interested in estimating the effect of a drug on blood pressure. While it is easy to show whether or not taking the drug is associated with an increase in blood pressure, it is surprisingly difficult to show that taking the drug actually caused an increase (or decrease) in blood pressure.</description>

      <description>Goodbye GitHub Pages, I hope you’re not too upset! After finding myself increasingly frustrated with GitHub Pages inability to cooperate with my website engine of choice, Hugo, I’ve decided to make a move. Here are the reasons why:
Having all of my project pages being subpages of my personal page felt weird.
 Dealing with git subtrees, merge conflicts on the master branch, and having to do all kinds of work-arounds to get Hugo to play nice with GitHub Pages was driving me crazy.</description>

      <description>Choosing a color palette for a visualization can be one of the most time consuming parts for perfectionists like me. It can be surprisingly difficult to decide on a palette that is both visually appealing and practical, but fortunately there do exist websites to help!
For example, Coolors shoots random, appealing, color palettes at you and you can swipe from one to the next with a hit of a space-bar.</description>

      <description>Last week I gave an SGSA seminar on interactive visualizations in R.
Here is a long-form version of the talk.
Why be interactive? Interactivity allows the viewer to engage with your data in ways impossible by static graphs. With an interactive plot, the viewer can zoom into the areas the care about, highlight the data points that are relevant to them and hide the information that isn’t.</description>

      <description>This week is the Docathon at BIDS (a.k.a. that wonderful place that I spend all my time).
A docathon is like a hackathon but is focused on developing material and tools for documentation. We have loads of projects signed up to receive some documentation-love and an impressive number of excited participants!
We kicked off the event with a series of tutorials for writing “good” documentation. I gave an R-specific tutorial where I discussed using devtools to both develop and document your package.</description>

      <description>Last week, practical statistics met to discuss all things ANOVA. Below you will find the slides from my talk, but read on if you would like to learn all about ANOVA.
   When ANOVA is used and who uses it? ANOVA is used far and wide by the scientific community and beyond. Unfortunately, scientists also frequently misuse ANOVA. A study by Wu et al. (2011) showed that from a survey of 10 leading Chinese medical journals in 2008, 446 articles used ANOVA, and of those articles, 59% of them used ANOVA incorrectly.</description>

      <description>superheat 0.1.0 is now available on CRAN. Superheat makes it easy to create extendable, cutomizable, and most importantly, beautiful heatmaps. It has increased flexibility and user-friendliness when compared to alternatives such as heatmap() and pheatmap().
For usage options see the vignette and for examples see the accompanying paper by Barter and Yu (2017).
You can install the latest version with:
install.packages(&amp;quot;superheat&amp;quot;) Stay tuned for new versions with added features and minor usability tweaks.</description>

      <title>How to Present Good</title>

      <description>This week I was asked to give a presentation on giving presentations.
So meta.
Anyway, my lack of desire to spend time writing something that may have already been written by someone else led me to find a number of existing slides written by others with the same goal: to present on presenting. The only problem was that although these slides all contained excellent tips on making and subsequently presenting talks, the slides themselves were perfect examples of what not to do when making slides; they were insurmountable walls of text.</description>

      <description>Making beautiful and customizable heatmaps just got way easier… Introducing the superheat R package!
Using superheat, it is now extremely easy to produce plots like the example below describing 10 randomly selected cars from the famous mtcars dataset.
library(superheat) set.seed(1347983) selected.rows &amp;lt;- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), 10) X.col &amp;lt;- matrix(&amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, ncol = ncol(mtcars), nrow = 10) X.col[scale(mtcars[selected.rows, ]) &amp;lt; 0] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; superheat(mtcars[selected.rows,], # add text X.text = round(as.matrix(mtcars[selected.rows, ])), X.text.col = X.col, # scale columns scale = T, # label aesthetics left.</description>

      <description>by Kellie Ottoboni, Rebecca Barter, Ryan Giordano, Sara Stoudt
In 2015, UC Berkeley experienced a series of high-profile sexual harassment incidents, prompting the graduate students in the Statistics Department to hold a roundtable event. While this response was initiated by overt sexual harassment, our discussion extended to other subtler gender biases. This article outlines the events that lead to the roundtable’s inception, the details of organizing and hosting the event, and our thoughts on what did and didn’t work.</description>

      <description>Pie charts are terrible Pie charts are notoriously terrible for data visualization. Humans are genuinely bad at comparing angles. Thus, the only reason one should ever use a pie chart is to make beautiful pie-chart-art.
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1)) pie( c(280, 60, 20), c(&amp;#39;Sky&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Sunny side of pyramid&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Shady side of pyramid&amp;#39;), col = c(&amp;#39;#0292D8&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;#F7EA39&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;#C4B632&amp;#39;), init.angle = -50, border = NA )  Figure 1: Pyramid pie chart art.</description>
