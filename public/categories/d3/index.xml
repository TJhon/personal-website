      <description>Over the new year I decided to work on my D3.js skills (rather than do the actual work that I probably should’ve done) by submitting an entry to the World Data Visualization competition.
The interactive version of the fruits of my labour can be found by clicking here. Below is a static screenshot.

Essentially, the first screen shows each country’s happiness score (and are colored accordingly using the viridis color palette).</description>

      <description>While living in Seattle, I rode to and from Fremont every day on the Burke Gilman bike trail. Little did I know that everytime I went past NE 70th St, I (along with everyone else) was being recorded… It turns out that hourly data of traffic on the Burke Gilman trail is publicly available online. I decided to try out my D3 skills and make a cute little visualization of an average day in the life of the Burke Gilman trail.</description>
