      <description>Materials prepared by Rebecca Barter. Package developed by Max Kuhn.
An interactive Jupyter Notebook version of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/rlbarter/STAT-215A-Fall-2017/tree/master/week11. Feel free to download it and use for your own learning or teaching adventures!
R has a wide number of packages for machine learning (ML), which is great, but also quite frustrating since each package was designed independently and has very different syntax, inputs and outputs.
This means that if you want to do machine learning in R, you have to learn a large number of separate methods.</description>
