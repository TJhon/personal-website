      <title>5 useful R tips from rstudio::conf(2020) - tidy eval, piping, conflicts, bar charts and colors</title>

      <description>Tip 1: Tidy evaluation Tip 2: Pipe into later arguments of a function using . Tip 3: Function conflicts workaround (no more dplyr::select()) Tip 4: geom_col(): you’ll never have to specify “stat = identity” for your bar plots ever again! Tip 5: Using show_col() for viewing colour palettes   This was my second year attending rstudio::conf() as a diversity scholar (and my first time as a speaker), and I was yet again blown away by the friendliness of the community and the quality of the talks.</description>

      <title>Visualizing world happiness</title>

      <description>Over the new year I decided to work on my D3.js skills (rather than do the actual work that I probably should’ve done) by submitting an entry to the World Data Visualization competition.
The interactive version of the fruits of my labour can be found by clicking here. Below is a static screenshot.

Essentially, the first screen shows each country’s happiness score (and are colored accordingly using the viridis color palette).</description>

      <title>Cycling the Burke Gilman Trail in Seattle</title>

      <description>While living in Seattle, I rode to and from Fremont every day on the Burke Gilman bike trail. Little did I know that everytime I went past NE 70th St, I (along with everyone else) was being recorded… It turns out that hourly data of traffic on the Burke Gilman trail is publicly available online. I decided to try out my D3 skills and make a cute little visualization of an average day in the life of the Burke Gilman trail.</description>

      <title>Getting fancy with ggplot2: code for alternatives to grouped bar charts</title>
      <link>/blog/2018-05-29_getting_fancy_ggplot2/</link>

      <description>Here I provide the code I used to create the figures from my previous post on alternatives to grouped bar charts. You are encouraged to play with them yourself!
The key to creating unique and creative visualizations using libraries such as ggplot (or even just straight SVG) is (1) to move away from thinking of data visualization only as the default plot types (bar plots, boxplots, scatterplots, etc), and (2) to realise that most visualizations are essentially lines and circles that you can arrange however you desire in space.</description>

      <description>At some point in your life you have probably found yourself standing face-to-face with a beast known as a grouped bar chart. Perhaps it was in a research paper where the authors were trying to compare the results of several models across different datasets, or it was in a talk given by a colleague who was trying to compare the popularity of different products among distinct groups of consumers.</description>

      <description>An interactive Jupyter Notebook version of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/rlbarter/ggplot2-thw. Feel free to download it and use for your own learning or teaching adventures!
Useful resources for learning ggplot2  ggplot2 book (https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387981403/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=ggplot2-20) by Hadley Wickham The layered grammar of graphics (http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf) by Hadley Wickham   Materials outline I will begin by providing an overview of the layered grammar of graphics upon which ggplot2 is built.</description>

      <title>Coolors: choosing color schemes</title>
      <link>/blog/2017-06-27-colors/</link>

      <description>Choosing a color palette for a visualization can be one of the most time consuming parts for perfectionists like me. It can be surprisingly difficult to decide on a palette that is both visually appealing and practical, but fortunately there do exist websites to help!
For example, Coolors shoots random, appealing, color palettes at you and you can swipe from one to the next with a hit of a space-bar.</description>

      <title>Interactive visualization in R</title>

      <description>Last week I gave an SGSA seminar on interactive visualizations in R.
Here is a long-form version of the talk.
Why be interactive? Interactivity allows the viewer to engage with your data in ways impossible by static graphs. With an interactive plot, the viewer can zoom into the areas the care about, highlight the data points that are relevant to them and hide the information that isn’t.</description>
