      <description>Pre-processing data in R used to be the bane of my existence. For something that should be fairly straightforward, it often really wasn’t. Often my frustrations stemmed from simple things such as factor variables having different levels in the training data and test data, or a variable having missing values in the test data but not in the training data. I’d write a function that would pre-process the training data, and when I’d try to apply it to the test data, R would cry and yell and just be generally unpleasant.</description>

      <description>When you’re learning to code and perform data analysis, it can be overwhelming to figure out how to structure your projects. To help data scientists develop a reproducible and consistent workflow, I’ve put together a short GitHub-based document with some guiding advice: https://github.com/rlbarter/reproducibility-workflow
If you’re interested in contributing or improving this document, please get in touch, or even better, submit a pull request (https://github.com/rlbarter/reproducibility-workflow)!
The document as of writing is shown below.</description>

      <title>A Basic Data Science Workflow</title>

      <description>Developing a seamless, clean workflow for data analysis is harder than it sounds, especially because this is something that is almost never explicitly taught. Apparently we are all just supposed to “figure it out for ourselves”. For most of us, when we start our first few analysis projects, we basically have no idea how we are going to structure all of our files, or even what files we will need to make.</description>
